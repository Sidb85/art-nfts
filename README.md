# art-nfts
Colab notebooks used for creating images through 'neural style transfer' for use as NFTs.

There were sets of NFTs created: one was taking Monalisa as base image and applying styles of other famous artists e.g. Van Gogh,Picasso, etc. The other set was taking different famous paintings as base images and applying other famous paintings fot style, creating a 'What If' scenario. This also had Indian artistses like Amrita SherGill.

Amrita Shergill is considered as Frida Kahlo of India. But what if Frida Kahlo had painted in the style of Amrita Shergill? Or vice versa.

What if Van Gogh visited India like The Beatles did decades later and got inspired? How would he have tackled what Raja Ravi Varma painted? Or what would be reverse take of Starry Night?

What if Gaganendranath Tagore’s style melded with PIcasso’s? Exciting to see both ways.

What is Constable’s spirit got into Gopal Ghose?

Imagined the above using Neural Style Transfer method and created a set of NFTs. Check them out  (and buy if you like :)) at Opensea.
